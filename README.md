Mbox to Maildir converter
=========================

Homepage (?)
------------
I first imported mb2md-3.20.pl from http://batleth.sapienti-sat.org/projects/mb2md/
It also refers an even older page http://www.firstpr.com.au/web-mail/mb2md/

Info
----

According to the information it appears to be open source (public domain)
code. Latest update on the web page above is apparently: 2006-05-07.

It seems to me the software is not really being maintained by anyone at the
moment - at least the page does not refer any active version control system
like Github.

I have not (yet) contacted the owner of the page.  If you want to do that,
go ahead.

My interest: I have done some cleanup only, and if I run into bugs during
my day-to-day usage, I try to fix them but that's it.  I basically just
want to _use_ the program. I don't intend to take over "maintainership". I
am storing the code here mostly as backup for myself, but if you fix
something then pull-requests are of course welcome.

Code maintenance principles
---------------------------

As I said, mostly stored for my own sake here... Since I'm not aware of any
forks right now, I might at any time get the urge to clean up, rebase and
force-push the repository  (You have been warned).
